## Installation

1. Git clone repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gunater/NumericalMethods.git
```
2. Install the necessary python dependencies you can use `pipenv`:
```bash
$ pipenv install
$ piipenv shell
```
or you can install from requirements.txt with `pip`:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Basic usages
The scripts have examples implemented in them. Just run the script.Below is a brief description of the scripts.
### 1. Gauss-Seidel.py
Program solving the system of linear equations using the Gauss-Seidel method.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 Gauss-Seidel.py
```
### 2. MonteCarlo.py
Calculation of the component values of quadrupole moment tensor
homogeneously charged solids by Monte-Carlo integration. In the example, half of the rotary ellipsoid lying in the xy plane - the data is the length of the semi-axis: a, b,
c, the centre of the section plane is at the origin of the coordinate system.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 MonteCarlo.py
```
### 3. Newton-method.py
Iterative algorithm for determining the approximate value of the element of function.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 Newton-method.py
```
### 4. Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg.py
Solving the differential equation using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg.py
```
### 5. Rungeâ€“Kutta-methods.py
third order Runge-Kutt method.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 Runge-Kutta-methods.py
```
### 6. approximation .py
Interpolation of selected points by lagrange method.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 approximation .py
```
### 7. binary.py
Binary representation of the decimal places.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 binary.py
```
### 8. interpolation.py
Comparison of interpolation using Neville's scheme based on uniformly distributed points and Chebyshev's points.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 interpolation.py
```
### 9. null-locations.py
Searching for places of interrupted functions.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 null-locations.py
```
### 10. trapezium-integration.py
The algorithm of integration by trapezoid method and the newton method.
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ python3 trapezium-integration.py
```
### minimum
Different methods for calculating the minimum function 
Run script with implemented example:
```bash
$ cd minimum/
$ python3 <method>.py
```
